# Overview

This paper tackles _Library Learning_(finding common abstractions within a corpus of programs) with E-Graphs. Because finding the smallest equivalent program is something E-Graphs do easily, using E-Graphs for Library learning reframes the problem as one of _compression_: finding abstractions which best reduce the total size of the given corpus plus the new library. 

We go about this by:

1. First, we take our input corpus of programs and generate an e-graph and run equality saturation (as usual).
2. Next (and first big idea of the paper), we generate candidate abstractions by running an _anti-unification_ algorithm to find "the most concrete pattern that matches two given terms". The insight of the paper is how to apply this algorithm to e-classes instead of individual nodes in an AST.
3. Now that we've generated some candidate abstractions, we need to find the subset of them which reduces the size of the entire corpus. We do this by reframing the problem as an E-graph problem: we simply feed back in the candidate abstractions as rewrite rules to our e-graph, and then finding the smallest term.

# Anti-Unification



# Reading Order
We'd recommend starting with Section 1 to understand the problem and the paper's framing, then reading Section 2 (Overview) in detail, which does a great job of explaining the intuition behind the main contributions. Sections 3,4, and 5 are close walkthroughs of the details. If you're very comfortable reading this kind of literature, you might be able to briefly skim section 3 which motivates the two contribution sections: 4 (anti-unification on e-graphs) and 5 (candidate selection). The evaluation (section 6) was well-written but felt fairly standard and straightforward, and therefore less relevant to our class discussion.  

Fig 9. on pg 16 was particularly helpful for understanding the concrete steps of the algorithm.
